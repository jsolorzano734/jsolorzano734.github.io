#### SPORES  

![](/assets/images/site_images/spores.jpg)

SPORES (Society Prioritizes Our Recruitment of Every Scholar) aims to attract undergraduate students from underrepresented and underserved communities (mentees) to attend the annual [Mycological Society of America](https://msafungi.org/) meeting and become MSA members. We will recruit established MSA members to act as mentors (PhD students, or mycologists with PhDs) to introduce and guide mentees at the MSA annual meeting, facilitating friendly and productive experiences with the goal of leading to long-term MSA membership and participation.  

#### Mission  

The mission of SPORES is to provide opportunities for first-time undergraduate students to be introduced to MSA by current mycologists (mentors) in a friendly and constructive environment, promoting a sense of belonging in society with the goal of retaining them as long-term members. To accomplish the mission of SPORES, we request MSA’s support mentee membership and annual meeting attendance. By providing financial aid, MSA will actively invest in its mission of promoting science equity and diversity in the society.
